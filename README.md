 # The Heavy Send

 On Oct 19th, Mechanical Engineering Students were evaluating the forces at play while being lowered after a top-rope climb.

 I volunteered to belay these students in return for data to answer a few questions of my own.

 1. How much Force do i apply on the quick-draw when i fall on lead?
 2. How much Force do i apply on the Top Rope anchor when i take a big whipper?
 3. How is the force distributed between the anchor, rope and the belayer?

# The experiment
 
 I was belayed by Roan who weighs 234.7 lbs, i weigh about 196 lbs. This is a nice ccheck when climbing as you would always prefer to have a belayer >= 50% of your weight.
 
 We were supervised by Mohammed, who we requested to turn on the sensors for the climb up. i asked Roan to feed me slack all the way to recreate a lead climbing experience.

 ## First Send
 The First dino attempt, i leaped too high, with the hold being too close to my upper torso. This resulted in a blood blister on my left hand to an unexpected fall.

 This generated a spike of 3.1 kN.

 ## Second Send
 The Second Dino attempt, i climbed a bit higher, and leaped for the top of the climb with no intention to reach it. I free fell for the next few seconds, creating a larger force tension on the anchor of 3.27 kN.
